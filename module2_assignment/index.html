	      		<p>Paris is filled with highly regarded museums, monuments and churches. Though you could easily spend your entire vacation admiring iconic sights like the Eiffel Tower and the Notre-Dame Cathedral, save some time for relaxing at sidewalk cafes during the day and enjoying drawn-out meals with amazing wine at night.</p>
